# Gravitational Orbits in a Binary System

## Circular Binary 

Suppose two stars with mass and radius $M_1$, $R_1$ and $M_2$, $R_2$ orbit in a circular trajectory.  Total mass is denoted $M = M_1 + M_2$.  The (constant, in this case) separation between the stars is denoted $d$.  The rotation frequency of the binary is then:
$$ \omega^2 = \frac{G M}{d^3} $$
