# gravbin
Repo for calculating 3-body orbits around a Keplerian binary, in particular to understand the rate of capture and collision of a third body. 

The numerical integration and much of the simulation bookkeeping is done with the 3rd-party Rebound python package.  The local package **gravbin** is mostly wrappers for Rebound and related utilities.
